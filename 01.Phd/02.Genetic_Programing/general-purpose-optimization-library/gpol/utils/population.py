class Population:
    """ Implementation of a Solution class for any OP.

   The purpose of a Search Algorithm (SA) is to solve a given
   Optimization Problem (OP). The solve process consists of travelling
   across the solve space (ùëÜ) in a specific manner (which is embedded
   in algorithm's definition). Some algorithms manipulate the whole
   set of solutions at a time to perform such a solve. For this
   reason, in scope of this library, a special class to efficiently
   encapsulate the whole population of candidate solutions was created.
   More specifically, to avoid redundant generation of objects to store
   a set of solution, their essential characteristics will be
   efficiently stored as a limited set of macro-objects, all
   encapsulated in class Population.


    Attributes
    ----------
    _pop_id : int
        A unique identification of a population object.
    repr_ : Object
        The solutions' representation in the population.
    valid : torch.Tensor
        The solutions' validity state under the light of ùëÜ.
    fit : torch.Tensor
        A tensor representing solutions' quality in ùëÜ. It is assigned
        by a given problem instance (PI), using fitness function (ùëì).
