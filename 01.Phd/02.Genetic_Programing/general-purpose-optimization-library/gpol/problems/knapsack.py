class Knapsack01(Problem):
    """ Implements 0-1 Knapsack OP

    Given a set of items, each characterized by a weight and a value,
    solving an instance of the Knapsack problem consists of determining 
    which items to include in the knapsack so that the total weight 
    is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as 
    large as possible.

    The code contained in this class implements the so-called 0-1
    Knapsack problem. In scope of this OP, a candidate solution is
    represented as a 1D tensor of zeros and ones which length equals
    the dimensionality of the solve space (i.e., the number of items);
    each index of a tensor corresponds to a given item in. In such a
    way, the items to be included are the ones for which the tensor
    holds a value 1; this means that, in 0-1 Knapsack OP, a given item
    can be included only once. The evaluation of a candidate solution
    consists of:
        1) validation of a candidate solution's weight (if it fits the
         maximum capacity of the Knapsack);
        2) calculation of the total value of a solution by summing
        value of those items which are mapped with a 1 in candidate
        solution's tensor.

    Note that the tensors representing candidate solutions, although
    holding 0-1 values, are stored as floats for operational reasons.
    For example, to allow torch.matmul and torch.dot functions to
    be applied without additional casts.
