class SSNFusionLogits(Problem):
    """ SS networks' fusion of logits by means of programs' induction.

    This class provides facilities to assess candidate solutions on a
    given Semantics Segmentation (SS) task. It assumes solutions'
    representation as trees of program elements, stored as lists, where
    the terminals stand for the SS networks' output logits (i.e., the
    volume prior predicted classes' generation by means of argmax).
    Under this perspective, a terminal has the following shape:
     [batch size X n¬∫ of classes X image's height X images' width]
    The tree represents networks' fusion policy.
